It is located 18 miles south-east of Central London and is situated adjacent to the London Borough of Bexley to its west.

Research Summary Answer: The Order of St. Augustine\n8.Final Report: Answer: In 15th century England, the religious order associated with Dertford was the Dominicans, also known as the Order of Preachers.\nConfidence Level: Medium\nDetails: In Thomas More's 'History of Richard III', it is mentioned that Brigette, one of King Edward IV's daughters, 'professed and observed a religious life in Dertford, a house of cloistered Nuns.' This information is supported by research which indicates that Dertford was a town located in Kent, England and that it was home to a number of religious institutions, including nunneries. However, it is also possible that the 'house of cloistered Nuns' referred to in the text was actually a convent of Dominican friars, as research indicates that Dertford had a Dominican convent during this time period. The Dominicans were a Catholic religious order founded by Saint Dominic in the early 13th century, and they were known for their commitment to preaching and teaching the Gospel. It is possible that the Dominicans, who were not traditionally associated with cloistered communities, adopted the term 'cloistered Nuns' to describe their convent in Dertford. It is important to note that the text does not specify the religious order to which Brigette belonged, so this assumption is based on the information available about the Dominicans in Dertford and the possibility that the reference to 'cloistered Nuns' may not be literal.\nExcellent, let's try another."

The Lord Chamberlain and some others keep their offices. Text: Section_33: But the Duke of Gloucester bore himself in open sight so reverently to the Prince, with all semblance of lowliness, that from the great obloquy in which he was so late before, he was suddenly fallen in so great trust, that at the Council next assembled, he was the only man chosen and thought most suitable to be Protector of the King and his realm, so that were it destiny or were it folly the lamb was given to the wolf to keep. At which Council also the Archbishop of York, Chancellor of England, who had delivered up the Great Seal to the Queen, was thereof greatly reproved, and the Seal taken from him and delivered to Doctor Russell, Bishop of Lincoln, a wise man and good and of much experience, and one of the best learned men undoubtedly that England had in his time. Diverse lords and knights were appointed unto diverse offices. The Lord Chamberlain and some others kept still their offices that they had before.\n3. Object of the Question: What was the function and purpose of the Great Seal.\n4. Historical Context: The text is describing events that took place in the late 15th century in England.\n5. Revised Question: What was the Great Seal in late 15th century England?\n 6. Research Summary: \nWhat is the Great Seal?: The Great Seal is a principal national symbol of the United States. The phrase is used both for the physical seal itself, which is kept by the United States Secretary of State, and more generally for the design impressed upon it.\nWhat was the purpose of the Great Seal in 15th century England?: The seal meant that the monarch did not need to sign every official document in person; authorisation could be carried out instead by an appointed officer. In centuries when few people could read or write, the seal provided a pictorial expression of Royal approval which all could understand.\n7. Research Summary Answer: The Great Seal was used to authorize documents on behalf of the monarch in 15th century England.\n8. Final Report:\nAnswer: In late 15th century England, the Great Seal was used to authorize documents on behalf of the monarch.\nConfidence Level: High\nDetails: The research summary states that the Great Seal was a symbol of national importance used to authorize documents in the absence of the monarch's personal signature. This information is supported by the text, which mentions that 'the Archbishop of York, Chancellor of England, who had delivered up the Great Seal to the Queen, was thereof greatly reproved, and the Seal taken from him and delivered to Doctor Russell, Bishop of Lincoln, a wise man and good and of much experience.' (S.33) This suggests that the Great Seal held significant power and authority and was entrusted to those who were responsible for carrying out the monarch's wishes. The transfer of the Great Seal from the Archbishop of York to Doctor Russell further emphasizes the importance of the seal and its role in the authorization of official documents.\nExcellent.

She often led the Lancastrian forces during the wars and dictated grand strategy.

Final Report with all three elements:\nAnswer: Margaret of Anjou was Queen of England and nominally Queen of France by marriage to King Henry VI.
