"Section_3: He was a goodly personage, and very princely to behold: of heart, courageous; politic in counsel; in adversity nothing abashed; in prosperity, rather joyful than proud; in peace, just and merciful; in war, sharp and fierce; in the field, bold and hardy, and nevertheless, no further than wisdom would, adventurous.

"Section_4: In which time of his latter days, this realm was in quiet and prosperous estate: no fear of outward enemies, no war in hand, nor none toward, but such as no man looked for; the people toward the Prince, not in a constrained fear, but in a willing and loving obedience; among themselves, the commons in good peace.

"Section_5: So died (as I have said) this noble king in that time during which his life was most desired. The love of his people and their entire affection toward him would have been to his noble children a marvelous fortress and sure armor (having in themselves also as many gifts of nature, as many princely virtues, as much goodly ability as their age could receive), if division and dissention of their friends had not unarmed them and left them destitute, and the execrable desire of sovereignty provoked their uncle to their destruction, who, if either kind  or kindness had held place, must needs have been their chief defense.

"Section_8: Richard, the third son, of whom we now treat, was in wit and courage equal with either of them, in body and prowess far under them both: little of stature, ill featured of limbs, crooked-backed, his left shoulder much higher than his right, hard-favored in appearance, and such as is in the case of lords called warlike, in other men called otherwise.

"Section_12: When these lords with diverse others of both parties were come into his presence, the King, lifting up himself and propped up with pillows, as it is reported, after this fashion said unto them: My lords, my dear kinsmen and allies, in what plight I lie, you see, and I feel. By which, the less while I expect to live with you, the more deeply am I moved to care in what case I leave you, for such as I leave you, such be my children like to find you. That if they should (God forbid) find you at variance, might by chance fall themselves at war before their discretion would serve to set you at peace. You see their youth, of which I reckon the only security to rest in your concord. For it suffices not that all you love them, if each of you hate the other. If they were men, your faithfulness by chance would suffice.

Which was perchance the thing that more easily made her incline unto the King's appetite when he required her. However, the respect of his royalty, the hope of gay apparel, ease, pleasure and other wanton wealth was soon able to pierce a soft tender heart. But when the King had abused her, at once her husband (as he was an honest man and one that could know his own good, not presuming to touch a King's concubine) left her up to him all together. When the King died, the Lord Chamberlain took her, who in the King's days, although he was sore enamored upon her, yet he endured her absence, either for reverence or for a certain friendly faithfulness., Text: Section_94:  Jane Shore was born in London to good friends. She married William Shore, an honest citizen, when she was young. When King Edward IV began to pursue her, she was easily swayed by the prospect of wealth and status. However, when the King died, her husband took her back, despite the fact that he had been enamored with her during the King's lifetime."

And yet, being even such, whosoever well observed her appearance might guess and devise which parts, how filled, would make it a fair face.

"Section_96: The King would say that he had three concubines in whom three diverse qualities differently excelled: one the merriest; another the wiliest; the third the holiest harlot in his realm, as one whom no man could get out of the church lightly to any place, but it were to his bed.

"Section_169: The Bishop was a man of great natural wit, very well learned, and honorable in behavior, lacking no wise ways to win favor.

Afterwards, he fled the realm, went to Rome, never minding more to meddle with the world till the noble prince, King Henry the Seventh, got him home again, made him Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of England, whereunto the Pope joined the honor of Cardinal.
