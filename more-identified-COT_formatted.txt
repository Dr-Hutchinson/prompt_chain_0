Text: Section_160: Which after that the wretches perceived, first by the struggling with the pains of death, and after long lying still, to be thoroughly dead, they laid their bodies naked out upon the bed, and fetched Sir James to see them. Who, upon the sight of them, caused those murderers to bury them at the stair-foot, suitably deep in the ground, under a great heap of stones./nSummary: Section_1:  King Edward IV was a beloved king who was interred at Windsor with great honor. He was especially beloved by the people at the time of his death. Text: Section_1: This noble prince died at his palace of Westminster and, with great funeral honor and heaviness of his people from thence conveyed, was interred at Windsor. He was a king of such governance and behavior in time of peace (for in war each part must needs be another's enemy) that there was never any prince of this land attaining the crown by battle so heartily beloved by the substance of the people, nor he himself so specially in any part of his life as at the time of his death./nSummary: Section_16:  King Edward IV, on his deathbed, forgave those who had wronged him and asked them to forgive each other. However, it was apparent from their actions that their hearts were not truly in it. Text: Section_16: And therewithal, the King, no longer enduring to sit up, laid himself down on his right side, his face toward them, and none was there present that could refrain from weeping. But the lords, encouraging him with as good words as they could and answering for the time as they thought to stand with his pleasure, there in his presence (as by their words appeared), each forgave the other and joined their hands together, when (as it after appeared by their deeds) their hearts were far asunder./nIdentification: Section_160 mentions the burial of Edward V and Prince Richard, but not Edward IV. Section_1 mentions the burial of Edward IV at Windsor. Section_16 doesn't mention any burials. Therefore, the answer is Section_1./nRelevant Sections: Section_1/nExcellent. Let's try another./nQuestion: Is Wales mentioned in the text?/nSections:/nSummary: Section_52:  The Cardinal responded that the Council would be content if the Duchess stayed with her children, but it would be better for the Duke of York to be with the King. He said that there are occasions when it is better for a child to be away from his mother, and this is one of those occasions. Text: Section_52: No man denies, good Madam, said the Cardinal, but that your Grace were of all folk most necessary about your children, and so would all the Council not only be content but also glad that you were, if it might stand with your pleasure to be in such place as might stand with their honor. But if you appoint yourself to tarry here, then think they yet more apt that the Duke of York were at his liberty honorably with the King to the comfort of them both than here as a sanctuary man to both their dishonor and obloquy. Since there is not always so great necessity to have the child be with the mother, but that occasion may sometime be such that it should be more expedient to keep him elsewhere. Which in this well appears that, at such time as your dearest son, then Prince and now King, should for his honor and good order of the country, keep household in Wales far out of your company, your Grace was well content therewith yourself./nSummary: Section_17:  After King Edward IV's death, his son Prince Edward moved towards London. He was accompanied by Sir Anthony Woodville, Lord Rivers, and other members of the queen's family. Text: Section_17: As soon as the King was departed, that noble Prince his son drew toward London, who at the time of his father's death kept household at Ludlow in Wales.  Such country, being far off from the law and recourse to justice, was begun to be far out of good will and had grown up wild with robbers and thieves walking at liberty uncorrected. And for this reason the Prince was, in the life of his father, sent thither, to the end that the authority of his presence should restrain evilly disposed persons from the boldness of their former outrages.  To the governance and ordering of this young Prince, at his sending thither, was there appointed Sir Anthony Woodville, Lord Rivers and brother unto the Queen, a right honorable man, as valiant of hand as politic in counsel. Adjoined were there unto him others of the same party, and, in effect, every one as he was nearest of kin unto the Queen was so planted next about the Prince./nSummary: Section_15:  On his deathbed, King Edward IV warns his people of the great hurt that could come to them if they fall into disagreement again. He urges them to love each other, for the sake of their country and their own safety. Text: Section_15: But since things passed cannot be brought back, much ought we the more beware by what occasion we have taken so great hurt before, that we soon afterwards fall not in that occasion again. Now be those griefs past, and all is (God be thanked) quiet, and likely right well to prosper in wealthful peace under your cousins, my children, if God send them life and you love. Of which two things, the less loss were they, if taken by God at his pleasure,  for yet should the realm always find kings, and by chance good kings. But if you among yourselves in a child's reign fall at debate, many a good man shall perish and perhaps he too, and you too, before this land find peace again. Wherefore in these last words that ever I look to speak with you, I exhort you and require you all, for the love that I have ever bore to you, for the love that our Lord bears to us all, from this time forward, all griefs forgotten, each of you love the other. Which I verily trust you will, if you anything earthly regard either God or your King, affinity or kindred, this realm, your own country, or your own surety./nIdentification: Section_52 mentions Wales in the context of the Duke of York being sent there. Section_17 mentions Wales in the context of Prince Edward being sent there. Section_15 does not mention Wales. Therefore, the answer is Section_52 and Section_17./nRelevant Sections: Section_52, Section_17/nExcellent. Let's try another./nQuestion: Are any ancient Romans mentioned in the text?/nSections:/nSummary: Section_77:  The Lords are astonished at Richard III's behavior and agree that whoever is responsible for his actions should be punished. Text: Section_77: At this question, all the lords sat astonished, musing much by whom this question should be meant, of which every man knew himself clear. Then the Lord Chamberlain, as he that for the love between them thought he might be boldest with him, answered and said that they were worthy to be punished as heinous traitors, whosoever they were. And all the others affirmed the same./nSummary: Section_97:  Jane Shore was a woman who was in good favor with the Prince and had many friends. However, she is now in a beggarly condition. Men tend to remember those who have done them evil, and Jane Shore is an example of someone who is not remembered because she did not do anything evil. Text: Section_97: I doubt not some shall think this woman too slight a thing to be written of and set among the remembrances of great matters, which they shall specially think, that by chance esteem her only by what they now see. But to me seems the change so much the more worthy to be remembered, in how much she is now in the more beggarly condition without friends and worn out of acquaintance after good substance, after great favor with the Prince, after great suit and seeking to by all those that those days had business to speed, as many other men were in their times, who be now famous only by the infamy of their ill deeds. Her doings were not much less, although they be much less remembered because they were not so evil. For men use, if they have an evil turn, to write it in marble; and whosoever does us a good turn, we write it in dust,  which is not worst proved by her, for at this day she begs of many at this day living, that at this day had begged if she had not been./nSummary: Section_124:  Henry Strafford, speaking at Guildhall, says that the people the king favored the most were always the ones who had the least power. He also says that more people went to Shore's wife, a prostitute, than to any of the lords in England, except for the ones who were her advocates. Text: Section_124: What manner of folk this King most favored, we shall for his honor spare to speak of; however, this know you well all, that whoso was best favored, bore always least rule, and more suit was in his days made unto Shore's wife, a vile and abominable strumpet, than to all the lords in England, except unto those that made her their advocate; and such a simple woman was well named and honest till the King, for his wanton lust and sinful affection, bereft her from her husband a right honest, substantial young man among you./nIdentification:  Section_77 does not mention any ancient Romans. Section_97 does not mention any ancient Romans. Section_124 does not mention any ancient Romans. Therefore, the answer is None./nRelevant Sections: None/n
