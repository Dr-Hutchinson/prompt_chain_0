SSS: 0.396\n4.Key Words: Edward V, Prince Richard, bodies, bury, Sir James\n5. Background knowledge and context: Edward V was one of the sons of King Edward IV and Prince Richard was his brother. Sir James was involved in their deaths and had their bodies buried.\n6.Relevance Determination: Medium\n7. Relevance Explanation: The key words 'Edward V' and 'Prince Richard' are related to the question as they are mentioned in the same sentence as 'bury'.

SSS: 0.369\nBased on the provided information, it appears that the section is potentially relevant to the question. The semantic similarity score is relatively high, indicating that there may be some connection between the section and the question. However, it is important to carefully examine the section and the question to determine the specific relevance.\n4.Key Words: The key words in the section that may be specifically and directly related to the question are 'King Edward,' 'Duke of Clarence,' 'Duke of York,' 'Elizabeth Lucy,' 'Prince,' and 'children.' These words refer to individuals or groups of people mentioned in the section.\n5. Background knowledge and context: Knowing that the question is asking about a person named Cecily, we can use our background knowledge about the context of the text to further assess the relevance of the section. The section mentions several individuals and groups of people, including King Edward, the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of York, Elizabeth Lucy, the Prince, and the children. Cecily is not mentioned by name in the section.\n6.Relevance Determination: Based on the key words identified in the section and our background knowledge of the context, it is unlikely that the section is relevant to the question. The section does not mention the name Cecily and does not provide any information about her. Therefore, I have a low degree of confidence in determining that the section is relevant to the question.\n7.Relevance Explanation: The section is not relevant to the question because it does not mention the name Cecily and does not provide any information about her.\n8.Final Output: Section_113: Irrelevant.\nExcellent.

Whose wars whosoever would well consider, he shall no less commend his wisdom when he withdrew than his manhood when he vanquished. He was of visage lovely, of body mighty, strong, and clean made; however, in his latter days with over-liberal diet , he became somewhat corpulent and burly, and nonetheless not uncomely; he was of youth greatly given to fleshly wantonness, from which health of body in great prosperity and fortune, without a special grace, hardly refrains.

SSS: The semantic similarity score (SSS) is 0.428, which is above the threshold of .40 and indicates that there is some potential relevance between the section and the question.\n4.

Relevance Determination: The relevance determination is high, as the section is directly and specifically related to the question.\n7. Relevance Explanation: The relevance explanation is that the section contains detailed descriptions of King Edward IV's appearance, including his physical appearance and any changes to it over time.\n8.

However, this score isn‚Äôt fully determinative, as other semantically related words in the Section can generate false positives.
